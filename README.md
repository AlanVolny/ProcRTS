ProcRTS - A small experiment with procedurally generated RTS units

===

The idea behind the experiment is you're given several units, which may be broken or different in some ways, and then you have to *make them work*. 

WASD to move the view, Q & E to zoom in/out. Left mouse to click / drag to select units, right click to move. Click on the facility to view current cash and produce units.

===

You must have [openfl](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/getting-started/installing-openfl/). I'll try to get downloads up when I can (last time I had trouble with getting it to export to Windows and Mac).

===

You have six units that're procedurally generated, with their names, looks, and stats. LIkewise, the enemy has six procedural units. You have a single facility that can produce units, and a steady flow of income. The enemy has 3+ facilities that produce <= 3 kinds of units, for defending their facility and attacking yours. The enemy spawns more facilities, and the difficulty goes up over time.

Sometimes you're given lots of fast units, sometimes lots of tanky units, and sometimes they all have awful vision. Repair units can be useful, but if the repair amount is too low they might be useless, unless they have a long enough range to safely heal out of danger.

I think the concept has *some* merit, but there has to be a lot of variety in the possible unit attributes for the resulting stew of units to be interesting. As it stands, there is too little variety amongst the units, making each set of units feel non-unique and clearly pointing to one or two 'best' units.
